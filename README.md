#  Validate the DC2 Mock Lightcone and Twinkles 2 mocks

Summary -- Once the input catalogs have been generated, there will be a validation phase that will use the
validation framework [Deliverable CS4.1](http://github.com/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/CS4.1) to compare observational and simulated data.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS8.2.1 ( 12/17 ): Use validation tools to show that the mock catalogs meet the stated requirements.

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
